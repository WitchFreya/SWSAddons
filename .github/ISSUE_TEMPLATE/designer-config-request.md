**Are you trying to retexture a vehicle/UAV/unit/similar, or gear?**
Unit or Gear.

**What is the class name of the item you want to retexture?**
Example: 41st_Pack_Away1

**What is the texture you're trying to change?**
Example: "\41st_ODST_MFR_Declassified_Assets\41Core\Armor\away\41backpack_co.paa" or 'I could not find it.'

If you couldn't find it, please include a screenshot of the area that you want to modify.

**Describe the nature of the texture changes you want to make.**

This is necessary so that we can give the new item a name. You're welcome to request a display name as well, we'll take it under advisement.

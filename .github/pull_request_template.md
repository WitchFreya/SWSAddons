<!-- Make sure you change the title of the PR above. Typically, you'll want it to match the following format: -->
<!-- feat/fix(addon?): Brief description of ten words or less; for example: feat(gear): Added a new armor variant  -->
<!-- If it changes multiple addons, you can either pick the major one it effects or omit the 'addon' portion, e.g. feat: Reworked a bunch of textures -->
<!-- The title above is what will appear in the changelog when a new release is made. -->

## Describe your changes

<!-- Below this line, include a brief description of what your PR accomplishes. One to two sentences is fine; the goal is so that someone can look back at the PR to see a description of changes that isn't briefly describe in the title. -->

## Screenshots (if appropriate)

<!-- Including a screenshot or two can help with reviewing PRs as well as looking back at them later. -->

# Mission Template

Hello Architect! Welcome to the mission template. To get started, you can either clone this repo using Git (if you're familiar), download as a ZIP (which may take a while), or manually create each of the files in this directory. Sometime in the future I'll make this a bit easier.

## Setup Checklist

- [ ] Make sure you populate each of the properties in the `Variables.hpp` file.
  - `MISSION_DATE` **must** have a comma in it to determine where to split the colors for the Zeus missionTitle script.
- [ ] Ensure that there are a number of player slots in the mission equivalent to whatever you put in `Variables.hpp`.
- [ ] Ensure that there is an extra Zeus slot specific to Platoon Lead, if you intend to have one during your mission.
  - If you do intend to have one, try to brief the PLT via an Eden screenshare or a Zeus walkthrough on your intentions for the mission before it begins.
  - Think of it this way: the Architect designs the railroad. The PLT makes sure the train runs on track. Let them be an asset to you during the op, there'll be more than enough other things to worry about.

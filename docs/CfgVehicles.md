Random scribblings about the CfgVehicles properties.

- For UAV/UGVs, they can only be accessed via a terminal of the same faction; this can be set with the `faction` property on the UAV/UGV.
- For `TextureSources`, the `textures[]` array **must include .paa on the file names** for the Splendid Garage to map to the variants properly.

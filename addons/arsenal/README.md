# Arsenal

This addon handles our base arsenal equipment; what should be in every arsenal.

Feel free to create an issue to adjust things inside of it. For those who know how to add code bits and bobs:

1. Create a branch.
2. Open up 3DEN editor.
3. Place down any object that an arsenal can be created on.
4. Double click on the object and go to `Object: ACE Arsenal`.
5. Change Mode to Blacklist.
6. Hit 'Add SWS Defaults'.
7. Add or remove anything you like here.
8. Hit Export, then paste the result into [defaultItems.sqf](./defaultItems.sqf).
9. Create a PR explaining the change.

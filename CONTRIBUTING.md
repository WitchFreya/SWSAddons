# Contributing

This file will contain some general guidelines for contributing that will be added to over time.

## SQF

1. Keep variables immutable. 
   1. If you must mutate a variable, name it `_mut_<varName>`.

## Naming

1. Folders should be named in snake case, e.g. `loadout_migration`.
2. Folders should always be named in lowercase, due to quirks with Windows.
